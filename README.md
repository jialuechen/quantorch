QuanTorch is a PyTorch-Based Python Library for Quantitative Finance.

## Introduction
QuanTorch is developed to empower quantitative research by providing modern deep learning computation and acceleration service. QuanTorch provides high-performance components leveraging the hardware acceleration support and automatic differentiation of PyTorch. QuanTorch supports foundational mathematical methods, mid-level methods, and specific pricing models, which is also an experimental light-weight alternative to QuantLib.

## Motivation
PyTorch provides two high-level features: 

* Tensor computing with strong acceleration via GPU
* Automatic Differentiation System

Quantorch makes use of these modern features on PyTorch library to build advanced stochastic models, high-performance pricing_models, PDE solvers and numerical methods.

## Installation
```
pip install --upgrade quantorch
```
